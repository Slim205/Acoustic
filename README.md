# Acoustic

This project aims to achieve the following objectives:

- Numerically solving the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for various geometries.
  
- Controlling the accuracy of numerical solutions for acoustic waves by adjusting mesh quality.
  
- Implementing a fractal to simulate irregularities in geometry.
  
- Investigating eigenmode localization and identification using energy loss and surface analysis.

Feel free to explore the project for detailed implementation and results. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
