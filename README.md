# Acoustic
This project aims at:

- Resolving the Helmholtz equation numerically with Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the boundary for different geometries.
  
- Controlling the numerical solution accuracy of acoustic waves by changing the quality of the mesh.

- Implementing a fractal that represents a possible irregularity in the geometry.

- Studying the localization of eigenmodes and identifying them using energy loss and the existing surface.
